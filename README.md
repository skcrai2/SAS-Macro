# SAS-Macro
Learn to use SAS Macro basics

The attached SAS code was used to answer the following questions:

1. Consider	the	flower	sales	data. Write	a	procedure	to	compute	the	
average quantity	of	sale.	Write	a	DATA	step	to	put	the	average	quantity	in	a	
macro	variable AVG.

2. Suppose we want to create several copies of a data set, but every time shuffled
randomly. 

  a).  Write a macro program with 4 parameters: input, nsets, seed, and output.
Where, “input” is the name of the existing data set, “nsets” is the number of randomly
shuffled data sets, “seed” is an integer-valued seed for RANUNI(), and “output” is the 
name of randomly shuffled (most recently generated) data set

  b).  Download	the	‘cork.xls’	file	from	D2L.	It	contains	5	variables: tree, 
north, east, south, west. Read this data file into SAS. Suppose this SAS
dataset name is ‘cork’.
